# React Netflix Clone
This project is a React-based Netflix clone that allows users to browse trending movies, search for specific genres, and watch trailers directly within the application. It leverages tools like Redux Toolkit for state management, React Router for navigation, styled-components for styling, and integrates with Firebase for user authentication. The Netflix clone fetches movie data from The Movie Database (TMDb) API, including images, genres, and trailers. Users can also add movies to their liked list and remove them. Additionally, the project demonstrates how to use the YouTube Data API to fetch trailers for movies, providing a comprehensive viewing experience. With this clone, users can explore and enjoy a Netflix-like interface, making it an engaging and interactive movie streaming application.
